		<h3>This is your limited profile.</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>It does not contain your full employment history.</li>
			<li>It does not contain personally identifiable information about your qualifications.</li>
			<li>It contains only your first name with an initial of the last name.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Why do you give out my current organization and partial name?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The same job role might vary significatly betweek two companies.</li>
			<li>We want to help companies keep a reference to the candidates that they invite.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How would the employers contact me?</h3>
		<p>After an employer tells us that they are interested in your profile, we will send you an email with a request. After you approve the request, we will send your full profile to the employer.</p>

		<h3>Why do you guys do it this way?</h3>
		<p>We respect your privacy. Employers usually request and keep a large amount of CVs which contain your personal data (like date of birth, contact numbers, addresseses). In wrong hands, this data could be used for anything between SMS spamming to your mobile phone and resetting your e-mail password. We only store the information that employers need, give access to it when they are looking to hire you, and revoke access when they are done with it.</p>
