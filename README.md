This is the front-end to one of my projects - hirewire.lk. It's a angularjs app with some love from angular-ui. I open sourced this at an attempt to demonstrate a few things that we got right in developing a large static app.

Of course, you would not be able to take this app for a spin without our backend, which we're considering open-sourcing in the near future minus some secret sauce.

We've got a few things that we're trying to iron out before our public beta. You can follow the ongoing development via checking out the branches.

If you'd like to be in the private beta, shoot me a message.
